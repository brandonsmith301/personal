Problem:

> You are playing a 2D game where your character is trapped within a `$6 \times 6$` grid. Your character starts at `$(0,0)$` and can only move up and right. 
>
>How many possible paths can your character take to get to `$(6,6)$`?

No matter the path we take, our total moves will be 12 where 6 are up and 6 are right.

We can compute the number of possible paths by computing the number of ways to choose 6 up moves out of 12 total moves. 

This is done by using the combination formula:

$$
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$

Where `$n$` is the total number of moves and `$r$` is the number of up moves. First we need to create a function which computes the factorial of a number.

```python
f = lambda n: 1 if n == 0 else n * f(n - 1)
```

This is a recursive function which computes the factorial of a number from `$n$` to `$1$`. In our example, the factorial of 6 is written as:

$$
6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720
$$

The function becomes convient espcially when we want to compute the factorial of a large number. You don't want to be doing this by hand..

To then compute the answer, we can use the combination formula but written as:

```python
n = 12
r = 6

print((f(n))/(f(r)*f((n-r))))
```

Which give us 924 possible paths.
