Problem:

> You have a fair `$40$`-sided and fair `$60$`-sided die in front of you. If you roll both, find the probability the `$60$`-sided die shows a strictly larger number than the `$40$`-sided die.

This is a simple counting problem where we count the number of outcomes where the `$60$`-sided die shows a strictly larger number than the `$40$`-sided die and divide by the total number of outcomes.

We can do this by using the following code:

```python
condition = []
all_possible = []

for i in range(1, 41):
    for j in range(1, 61):
        if i < j:
            condition.append((i, j))
        all_possible.append((i, j))
```

Which gives us:

`$$\frac{1580}{2400} = \frac{79}{120} \approx 0.658$$`
